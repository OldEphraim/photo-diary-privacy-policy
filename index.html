        <p>While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="data-sharing">
        <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties.
